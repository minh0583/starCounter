## Requirements

The app requires a user to be signed in in order to work. This can be done with the [SignIn](https://github.com/starcounterapps/signin) app. If there are no users in the database, [create the first user](https://github.com/starcounterapps/signin#create-the-first-user). Otherwise, [sign in an existing user](https://github.com/starcounterapps/signin#sign-in)
